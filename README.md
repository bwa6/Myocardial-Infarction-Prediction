# Myocardial-Infarction-Prediction
Predicting death of patients using data from three days of hospital visits

This project uses a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  The dataset contains data collected from patients over three days at a hospital following an episode of myocardial infarction.  During graduate school, I studied cardiac tissue engineering to create stem cell-derived cardiac tissues that can be implanted on the heart following myocardial infarction, so naturally I took an interest in this dataset.  I was interested in my ability to understand the medical terminology represented by each feature in the dataset to properly clean the data of any missing values.  I researched the features to recognize relationships among features to properly impute missing data.

After cleaning the data, I used the dataset to practice supervised learning classifiers, including K-nearest neighbors, random forests, and support vector machines.  I used grid searches with cross-validation to optimize the hyperparameters to get the most accurate fit.  Lastly, I generated ROC curves to determine the thresholds to optimize precision vs. recall.  In the case of predicting death, it is particularly important to maximize recall so that we can identify as many patients at risk of dying as possible.  Ultimately, I developed an optimized support vector machine algorithm with a 75% recall with less than 10% false negative rate.

This project improved my skills in data wrangling and machine learning algorithms. I have only just begun my pursuit of data science as a career. I recently graduated with a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering and have taken a rather long break after graduation due to a shocking diagnosis with a brain tumor. I have begun the long road to recovery since the surgery in December 2020. I have been rigorously and enthusiastically been exploring the field of data science since the beginning of February.  I have learned a lot from numerous online courses and several textbooks.  This represents my second mini-data science project to practice my new skills as I learn them.  This has been an exciting time despite a difficult recovery from both brain surgery and COVID!
